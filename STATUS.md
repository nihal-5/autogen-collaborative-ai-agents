# AutoGen Multi-Agent System - Summary

## ✅ PRODUCTION-READY SYSTEM

**What's Complete:**
- ✅ **5 working demos** (tested end-to-end)
- ✅ **All core AutoGen patterns** (Labs 1-3 fully implemented)
- ✅ **Production features** (web dashboard, 4-agent system, tools)
- ✅ **Comprehensive documentation** (README, walkthrough, features list)

## Working Demos

1. `demo.py` - 2-agent collaboration (Researcher + Critic) ✅
2. `multi_agent.py` - 4-agent system with tools ✅
3. `autogen_core_demo.py` - AutoGen Core with RoutedAgents ✅
4. `dashboard.py` - Web interface with real-time streaming ✅
5. `app.py` - Code review team with execution ✅

## Lab Features Coverage

| Lab | Features | Status |
|-----|----------|--------|
| Lab 1 | Basic agents, tools, DB | ✅ Complete |
| Lab 2 | Teams, termination, multi-agent | ✅ Complete |
| Lab 3 | AutoGen Core, RoutedAgent, Runtime | ✅ Complete |
| Lab 4 | Distributed gRPC | ⚠️ Code written, API issues |

**Lab 4 Note:**  Distributed runtime has API incompatibility with AutoGen 0.4.0. However, AutoGen Core (Lab 3) already demonstrates agent communication and routing - the key distributed concepts without gRPC complexity.

## Tools & Capabilities

- **Web Search**: Google Serper integration
- **Code Execution**: Safe Python sandbox
- **File Management**: Save/read files
- **Real-time UI**: Server-Sent Events streaming
